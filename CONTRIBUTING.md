# Contribution guide

Thanks for considering to contribute! ðŸ˜€ We welcome all contributions, no matter who you are, and no matter whether it's big or small. With this guide, we aim to make contributing as clear and easy as possible.

## What counts as a contribution?

Anything that helps improving Fullstaq Ruby, whether directly (through a pull request) or indirectly (by engaging with us) counts as a contribution. Here's a non-exhaustive list:

 * Reporting an issue.
 * Triaging issues: determining whether an issue report is clear enough, whether the issue still persists, and whether it is reproducible.
 * Updating documentation.
 * Proposing an improvement.
 * Sending a pull request.
 * Reviewing someone else's pull request.

 ## Not sure how to get started?

Fullstaq Ruby consists of **multiple projects**. Every project has different requirements on skillsets, and has its own contribution guide. So have a look and choose one you like:

 * [Server Edition](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-server-edition/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
 * [Infrastructure](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-infra/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
 * [Fullstaq Rbenv](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-rbenv)
 * [Website](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-website)

To understand where we're heading, and thus what contributions might be valuable, please take a look at:

 * [Overview of all issue trackers](ISSUE_TRACKERS.md)
 * [Project roadmap](ROADMAP.md)

Issues with the following labels are good starting points:

 * "good first issue" if you're looking for something easy.
 * "help wanted" if you're in for a challenge, or if you want to help with a high-impact issue.
